# Contact Book Mini-Capstone

**This would probably not be a 'real' capstone as it doesn't really solve any 'problem'.** It's purpose is illustrative. It's on you to connect some (or all) of the concepts here to your capstones.

## Overview

### Primary Steps (Front-End)

1. Apply the _repository pattern_ to `fetch` some users from the [Random User API.](https://randomuser.me/documentation)

2. Create _React_ components for cards similar to the one seen [here.](https://randomuser.me/). At a minimum, include:

- Name
- ‚úâÔ∏è
- üéÇ
- ‚òéÔ∏è

**To be continued...**

## Available Scripts

**Run `yarn`. _Do not_ use `npm` as it can lead to some unnecessary conflicts from `yarn` and `npm`.**

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
